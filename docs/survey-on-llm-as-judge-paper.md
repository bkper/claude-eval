## Abstract

Accurate and consistent evaluation is crucial for decision-making across numerous fields, yet it remains a challenging task due to inherent subjectivity, variability, and scale. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable and flexible assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on LLM-as-a-Judge, offering a formal definition and a detailed classification, while focusing on addressing the core question: **How to build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?** We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions. This survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field.

## 1. Introduction

> "Judgment is the faculty of thinking the particular as contained under the universal. It involves the capacity to subsume under rules, that is, to distinguish whether something falls under a given rule."  
> — Kant, Critique of Judgment, Introduction IV, 5:179; Critique of Pure Reason, A132/B171.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across numerous domains, ranging from technical fields to the humanities and social sciences. Building on their success, the concept of using LLMs as evaluators—commonly referred to as "LLM-as-a-Judge"—has gained significant attention, where LLMs are tasked with determining whether something falls within the scope of a given rule.

### The Evaluation Dilemma

Before the era of LLMs, finding a balance between comprehensive and scalable evaluation posed a persistent challenge:

**Expert-Driven Assessments:**
- **Strengths:** Integrate holistic reasoning and fine-grained contextual understanding (gold standard in comprehensiveness)
- **Weaknesses:** Costly, difficult to scale, susceptible to inconsistency

**Automatic Metrics:**
- **Strengths:** Strong scalability and consistency (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE)
- **Weaknesses:** Heavily rely on surface-level lexical overlaps, fail to capture deeper nuances

**LLM-as-a-Judge Solution:**
- Combines scalability of automatic methods with detailed, context-sensitive reasoning
- Flexible enough to handle multimodal inputs under appropriate prompt learning or fine-tuning
- Serves as a novel and broadly applicable paradigm for complex evaluation problems

### Key Challenges

1. **Absence of Systematic Review:** Lack of formal definitions, fragmented understanding, and inconsistent usage practices
2. **Reliability Concerns:** Merely employing LLM-as-a-Judge does not ensure accurate evaluations aligned with established standards

### Core Research Question

**How to build reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems?**

## 2. Background and Method

### Formal Definition

LLM-as-a-Judge can be formally defined as:

```
E ← P_LLM(x ⊕ C)
```

Where:
- **E:** The final evaluation obtained from the whole LLM-as-a-Judge process (score, choice, label, sentence, etc.)
- **P_LLM:** The probability function defined by the corresponding LLM (auto-regressive process)
- **x:** The input data in any available types (text, image, video) waiting to be evaluated
- **C:** The context for input x (often prompt template or combined with history information)
- **⊕:** The combination operator that combines input x with context C

### LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation Pipeline

The basic approaches can be classified into four main components:

#### 2.1 In-Context Learning

Evaluation tasks are specified using In-Context Learning methods with four different approaches:

##### 2.1.1 Generating Scores
- **Discrete scores:** 1-3, 1-5, 1-10 ranges
- **Continuous scores:** 0-1 or 0-100 ranges
- **Simple scoring:** Basic range and criteria in context
- **Complex scoring:** Detailed criteria like Likert scale scoring functions

**Example Template:**
```
Please rate the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, level of details of their responses. Each assistant receives an overall score on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher score indicates better overall performance.
```

##### 2.1.2 Solving Yes/No Questions
- Simple and direct judgment on given statements
- Often used in intermediate processes for feedback loops
- Common for testing knowledge accuracy and factual alignment

**Example Template:**
```
Is the sentence supported by the article? Answer "Yes" or "No".
Article: {Article}
Sentence: {Sentence}
```

##### 2.1.3 Conducting Pairwise Comparisons
- Comparing two options and selecting the superior one
- More aligned with human evaluations than score-based assessments
- Options include Two-Option, Three-Option (with tie), and Four-Option modes

**Example Template:**
```
Given a new article, which summary is better? Answer "Summary 0" or "Summary 1".
You do not need to explain the reason.
Article: {Article}
Summary 0: {Summary_0}
Summary 1: {Summary_1}
```

##### 2.1.4 Making Multiple-Choice Selections
- Providing several options for broader range of responses
- Assesses deeper understanding or preferences
- Less common than the first three methods

#### 2.2 Model Selection

##### 2.2.1 General LLM
- Advanced models like GPT-4 as automated proxies for human evaluators
- High accuracy compared to professional human evaluators
- Superior consistency and stability in evaluations

##### 2.2.2 Fine-tuned LLM
- Address privacy concerns and evaluation reproducibility
- Typical process involves three main steps:
  1. **Data Collection:** Instructions, objects to evaluate, and evaluations
  2. **Prompt Design:** Structure based on evaluation scheme
  3. **Model Fine-Tuning:** Following instruction fine-tuning paradigm

**Examples:**
- **PandaLM:** Constructs data from Alpaca instructions and GPT-3.5 annotation
- **JudgeLM:** Uses diversified instruction sets and GPT-4 annotations
- **Auto-J:** Trains on multiple scenarios for generative evaluation
- **Prometheus:** Defines thousands of evaluation criteria with GPT-4 feedback

#### 2.3 Post-processing Methods

##### 2.3.1 Extracting Specific Tokens
- Rule-based extraction for scores, options, or Yes/No responses
- Challenges with response format variance
- Requires clear output format instructions

##### 2.3.2 Constrained Decoding
- Enforces structured output using finite state machines
- Recent solutions include DOMINO, XGrammar, SGLang
- Minimizes overhead through precomputation and speculative decoding

##### 2.3.3 Normalizing Output Logits
- Convert Yes/No settings to continuous decimals (0-1)
- Aggregate probability of relevant tokens
- Example: ρ_final = ρ_Self-consistency × ρ_Self-reflection

##### 2.3.4 Selecting Sentences
- Extract sentences or paragraphs for specific content
- Used in reasoning tasks to build reasoning trees
- Iteratively consider most promising reasoning steps

#### 2.4 Evaluation Pipeline Applications

The pipeline is commonly applied in four scenarios:

##### 2.4.1 LLM-as-a-Judge for Models

- Enable feedback-driven decision making

##### 2.4.4 LLM-as-a-Judge for Reasoning/Thinking
- Central to intellectual tasks like decision-making and problem-solving
- **Two frameworks:**
  1. **Training time:** Scaling through step-by-step verification and self-refinement
  2. **Test time:** Evaluating and selecting best reasoning paths
- Essential for "Best-of-N" generation scenarios

### 2.5 Quick Practice Guide

Four-stage process for effective LLM-as-a-Judge implementation:

1. **Thinking Phase:** Define evaluation objectives and understand human evaluation approaches
2. **Prompt Design:** Specify scoring dimensions, emphasize relative comparisons, create effective examples
3. **Model Selection:** Choose large-scale model with strong reasoning and instruction-following abilities
